Crossworlds of Friendship â€“ Unity 6.2 Fix Pass (2025-09-15)

âœ… What I verified (no changes needed):
- Obsolete API calls are gated behind UNITY_2023_1_OR_NEWER and use FindFirst/FindAny variants in 6.2.
- Pause Menu: static PauseMenuController.OpenPauseMenu() is present and used from UIController & MainMenuController.
- Character Sheet: CharacterSheetController includes ToggleCharacterSheet() and proper show/hide.
- "Changeling" content removed; PortraitLoader allows EarthPony/Unicorn/Pegasus/Griffon/Dragon/Human/BatPony only.
- UI bottom bar buttons wire up with .clicked handlers and call the correct methods.
- UIController_BarsPatch simulates 'gap' with child margins (Unity 6.2 IStyle has no gap property).

ðŸ›  What I changed:
- Added placeholder portraits for BatPony (Female/Male) by copying the BatPony silhouette so all race/gender
  folders contain a portrait.png (prevents missing-resource issues at runtime):
    Assets/Resources/Portraits/BatPony/Female/portrait.png
    Assets/Resources/Portraits/BatPony/Male/portrait.png

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- GlobalAdapters.cs provides legacy global-type names (CharacterSheetController, PauseMenuController) that derive
  from the namespaced implementations. This is intentional for older call sites; current code references the
  adapters explicitly where needed (e.g., `global::PauseMenuController.OpenPauseMenu()`).
- Scene and script organization appear consistent with current code. Recovery scenes under Assets/_Recovery/ are
  editor crash recovery backups and can be removed from source control if not needed.
- TextMesh Pro, URP settings, and SceneTemplate assets are stock and safe to keep; they do not affect build size
  significantly in development.

If you hit any remaining compiler errors/warnings, send the full Unity console output (copy text)
and Iâ€™ll zero in on those specific files next.

- Rewrote CharacterSheetController.cs to avoid fullscreen behavior, add robust close (overlay click + ESC),
  and provide static helpers (Open/Close/Toggle). Starts hidden by default and relies on USS for sizing.
