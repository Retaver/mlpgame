# Portraits Setup (Resources/Portraits)

Place your character images at:
- `Assets/Resources/Portraits/<Race>/<Gender>/portrait.png`

Supported Race folders:
- EarthPony, Unicorn, Pegasus, Griffon, Dragon, Human

Supported Gender folders:
- Female, Male

You can replace each `portrait.png` with your custom OC art. The `CharacterCreationPortraitBinder`
script will automatically load the correct image based on the selected race/gender.
