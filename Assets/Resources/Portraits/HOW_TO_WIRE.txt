Drop-in wiring for Character Creation portraits & pause menu:

1) Character Creation
   - Add BOTH components to your Character Creation UIDocument GameObject:
     • CharacterCreationPortraitBinder
     • CharacterCreationAutoBinder
   - Keep your existing race/gender controls. The AutoBinder will find them automatically.
   - Place art under Resources/Portraits/<Race>/<Gender>/portrait.png (folder-first),
     or name your sprites like "earthpony_female.png" anywhere under Resources/Portraits
     (the binder will auto-detect by name).

2) In-Game HUD (MLPGameUI)
   - Ensure MLPGameUI is on the HUD UIDocument.
   - Buttons supported out of the box:
     • "CharacterButton" / class "character-button" / text contains "character"
     • "MenuButton" / class "menu-button" / text contains "menu"
     • "OptionsButton" / class "options-button" / text contains "option"

3) Main Menu
   - Add MainMenuPauseOptionsBinder to the Main Menu UIDocument.
   - Clicking Options will:
     • Show a PauseMenuController in the current scene (if present), OR
     • Schedule the Pause Menu to auto-open after loading the next scene.
