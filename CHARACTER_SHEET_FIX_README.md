# Character Sheet Fix - Complete Solution

## What Was Fixed

The character button wasn't working because of conflicts between two UI systems:
1. **MLPGameUI** - handles the character button and shows the character sheet
2. **UIController** - also tried to handle the character button, causing conflicts

## The Solution

### 1. MLPGameUI Takes Complete Control
- MLPGameUI now exclusively handles the Character button
- UIController skips wiring the Character button when MLPGameUI is present
- Character sheet is embedded directly in MLPGameUI.uxml

### 2. Simplified Character Sheet Logic
- Removed complex fallback logic
- Character sheet shows/hides directly in MLPGameUI's own UIDocument
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 3. Added Test Script
- `CharacterSheetTester.cs` - attach to any GameObject to verify functionality
- Press **C** key during gameplay to test character sheet programmatically

## How to Test

1. **Attach CharacterSheetTester** to any GameObject in your scene
2. **Run the game** - check console for test results
3. **Click Character button** - character sheet should appear
4. **Click tab buttons** - switch between Attributes, Skills, Perks, Effects
5. **Click Close button** - character sheet should disappear
6. **Press C key** - test character sheet programmatically
7. **Press 1-4 keys** (when character sheet is open) - test tabs programmatically:
   - **1** = Attributes tab
   - **2** = Skills tab
   - **3** = Perks tab
   - **4** = Effects tab

## Expected Debug Output

When the game starts, you should see:
```
[MLPGameUI] Singleton instance set
[MLPGameUI] UIDocument found and ready
[MLPGameUI] Character sheet modal initialized as hidden
[MLPGameUI] Wired Character button: CharacterButton (text: Character)
[MLPGameUI] Wired Character Sheet close button.
[MLPGameUI] Wired stats tab button
[MLPGameUI] Wired skills tab button
[MLPGameUI] Wired perks tab button
[MLPGameUI] Wired effects tab button
=== CHARACTER SHEET TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ===
```

When clicking tabs:
```
[MLPGameUI] Switching to tab: skills
```

## Character Sheet Features

### Tabs
- **Attributes** - Shows character stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)
- **Skills** - Shows character skills and skill points
- **Perks** - Shows special abilities and perks
- **Effects** - Shows active status effects

### Tab Switching
- Click any tab button to switch panels
- Only one panel visible at a time
- Active tab is highlighted with "active" class
- Keyboard shortcuts (1-4) for testing

## Troubleshooting

### If Character Button Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Console Logs** - look for error messages
2. **Verify MLPGameUI Setup**:
   - MLPGameUI script attached to GameObject with UIDocument
   - MLPGameUI.uxml assigned to UIDocument
   - CharacterSheet.uss stylesheet loaded

3. **Check Button Names**:
   - Character button should be named "CharacterButton"
   - Close button should be named "close-button"
   - Character sheet modal should be named "character-sheet-modal"

4. **Test with CharacterSheetTester**:
   - Attach to any GameObject
   - Check console for detailed diagnostics

### If Tabs Don't Work:

- Check that all tab buttons are found: `stats-tab`, `skills-tab`, `perks-tab`, `effects-tab`
- Check that all panels are found: `stats-panel`, `skills-panel`, `perks-panel`, `effects-panel`
- Verify tab click handlers are wired correctly
- Check console for tab switching debug messages
- Test with keyboard shortcuts (1-4 keys)

### If Wrong Panel Shows:

- Check that `InitializeTabs()` is called when character sheet opens
- Verify panel display styles are set correctly
- Check that `UpdateTabStyling()` is working properly

## Files Modified

- `Assets/Project/Art/UI/UXML/MLPGameUI.uxml` - Added embedded character sheet
- `Assets/Project/Scripts/UI/MLPGameUI.cs` - Complete rewrite of character button logic
- `Assets/Project/Scripts/UI/UIController.cs` - Prevent conflicts with MLPGameUI
- `Assets/Project/Scripts/Utilities/CharacterSheetTester.cs` - New test script

## Key Changes Made

1. **MLPGameUI.OnCharacter()** - Simplified to directly show/hide embedded character sheet
2. **MLPGameUI.OnCharacterClose()** - Directly hide character sheet in MLPGameUI
3. **UIController** - Added logging to confirm it skips character button when MLPGameUI present
4. **Debug Logging** - Added throughout to track button wiring and clicks

The character sheet should now work reliably without conflicts!
